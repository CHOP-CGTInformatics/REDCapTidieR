```{r, include = FALSE}
NOT_CRAN <- identical(tolower(Sys.getenv("NOT_CRAN")), "true")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  purl = NOT_CRAN,
  eval = NOT_CRAN
)
```

The {REDCapTidieR} package provides an elegant way to import data from a [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) database into an R environment. It builds upon the [{REDCapR}](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/) package to query the REDCap API and then transforms the returned data into a set of tidy tibbles. {REDCapTidieR} is especially useful for dealing with complex databases that are longitudinal or include repeated instruments or both.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `REDCapTidieR` like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("CHOP-CGTDataOps/REDCapTidieR")
```

## Getting Started

Use `read_redcap_tidy()` together with `bind_tables()` to import data from all instruments into your environment.
